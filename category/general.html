</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So yep. Another blog. By a former consultant turned product manager
working in tech. Shit, if I'd just done an MBA I could have really
hit the cliche trifecta...</p>
<p>So what's this one about? Thematically, it will probably be a mish-mash.<br>
The struggles of an insecure, overachiever to relax and appreciate just how lucky they are. How I've managed the transition from consultant to product person. Random thoughts about technology, pop-culture and how people make decisions. Basically, it will be as messy as most people's lives are. Which is not to diarise or make too much a mockery of the form - posts won't be ending in XOXO</p>
<p>At the same time, writing this is about feeling creative and playful with words again, and to feel like I've learnt something in the last couple of years. To that end:<br>
- No business jargon. When it took me 15 minutes to think of how a normal person would say "deep dive", I knew I had a problem<br>
- This is in Markdown, on a Pelican static blog (wooh Python), and committed to Git so that everything is saved for me to cringe over in a couple of years<br>
- Pop-culture references and occasional profanity are staples of my spoken English. So are puns and the straying towards the pretentious  </p>                </article>
