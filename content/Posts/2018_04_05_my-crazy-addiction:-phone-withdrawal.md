Summary: What happens when I lose my phone
Status: published

I had my phone stolen in Ethiopia. Couple of kids grabbed at me, while one slipped into my pocket, and that was that. Afterwards, an epic journey through the Addis policing system that left us fearing we were more likely to be arrested than given a report. And that was only after visiting 5 different police stations  

Anyway, the first week after taught me a bit about myself. The phone I wrote off immediately. But it felt like a part of me had left with it. Maybe that's a little melodramatic, but it terrifies me how dependant I've become  

There are the practical dependencies. If something goes wrong, I can't call out. I can't use maps to find my way around the city. It's much harder to find or book a hotel or restaurant. To take photos of beautiful or interesting things. To message friends and family to let them know I'm ok or to make them jealous. These are all valid reasons why losing your phone is the worst.

However, my phone had become more than these specific actions. It has become the way in which I pass the dead minutes in a taxi scrolling through Facebook. Or the 15 minutes that turn into an hour reading the news when I should be going to bed. Sitting on the toilet doing German language exercises or checking my email when I wake up. It's Spotify on the way to gym, my workout app at the gym, and food delivery afterwards. Tracking my habits, typing into my journal and reading blogs  

In the days immediately after, I would reach into my pocket, like an amputee searching for a lost limb. Isn't it bleak (and probably callous) that this is the comparison that comes to mind. But that's how it hit my mental state when I'm in the airport watching everyone else fiddle with their phones while I sit there lost for what to do with my new-found time  

Of course, a couple of days later and the fever begins to break. I miss how my phone can simplify my life. To get home from a restaurant late at night I ask a mate to order me an Uber while he gets a Taxify. But I find a bit more time to work, read, people watch and even talk to others. And transfer some of my addiction onto my laptop, which has probably never felt so loved

My new phone arrives in a couple of weeks, and I'm sure I'll slip headlong back into it. But until then, I can take a breath and remember that there was a world before my mobile
