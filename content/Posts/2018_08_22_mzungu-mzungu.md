Summary: Cultural sensitivity and being that white guy in Kenya
Status: draft

This was on my mind a lot, and although I'm not the best person to deal with this topic, I'll try - in a fumbling, but well-intentioned way  

As a first generation Russian/Moldovan-Jew in Australia, I'm aware that I come with some ethnic history. I have some different views on progress, relationships and money, coloured by the experiences of my parents and how they chose to impart them to me. Moreover, I've faced token amount of racism - mostly in the form of casual anti-semitism. And even that has been ok, because let's be honest, I'm pretty casually Jewish. Certainly I've never had anyone assume I'm not Australian for my skin colour, I don't get checked going through customs, and if I knew how to drive, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have a problem getting pulled over either. So yeah, there's a whole set of people in wealthy Anglo "first world" countries that have it much worse than me on an ethnic / racial basis.  

(Aside 1: This is not to dismiss any other form of discrimination)  
(Aside 2: Fun fact about the term "first world". The term initially referred to the Cold War conflict. America and allies were First World, the Soviet Union was Second World, and unaligned nations were Third World. Which makes Switzerland Third World. Nonetheless, the term should be retired - it tends to have really colonial implications in the modern context)  

Anyway, what I wanted to be careful of was being another white guy to Kenya to "save them". Particularly given I was going to be working for yet another NGO. And while I managed to avoid the saviour complex, on the ground things aren't exactly as simple as all that.  

In Kenya, everybody is about the hustle. One friend works an IT job, while creating websites for businesses, running a blog / news site, and building a marketplace for farming advice on the side. And expats form a weird aspect of that world - an opportunity to make some money.

So what have I learnt, coming back from the trip?  
- Not taking for granted interactions with authority. Definitely don't always have the public's best interest at heart
- If someone takes offence at something I say, they probably have a good reason. There's no value in saying "I didn't mean it" - try to learn from it and apologise
- Don't assume the issues that are important or relevant to me, are the same for me. I might care about the left-right political divide, but when you are hustling for food or hoping for basic infrastructure, that's not your biggest concern
- That the best way to understand what life is like for others is to experience it and to ask questions. Being conceptually "aware" of issues only takes you so far

Yet when you walk around on the streets, you'll hear people calling out to you "mzungu, mzungu" - basically, hey white person. And you'll be asked for money, followed
