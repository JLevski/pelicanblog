Summary: Cultural sensitivity and being that white guy in Kenya
Status: published

Cultural sensitivity was on my mind a lot in Nairobi. As a first generation Russian/Moldovan-Jew in Australia, I have a history with a token amount of casual anti-semitism. But to be honest, it has been pretty ok. Certainly I've never had anyone assume I'm not Australian for my skin colour, I don't get checked going through customs, and if I knew how to drive, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have a problem getting pulled over either.   

Anyway, working for a local NGO in Kenya, I wanted to avoid being another white guy to Kenya to "save them". Which I hope I managed to. And had a bunch of interesting experiences and life lessons along the way.  

Some lessons (for me):  
- Not taking for granted interactions with authority. They don't always have the your best interest at heart. It's not that they are inherently bad, just self-interested
- Don't assume the issues that are important or relevant to me, are the same for everyone. I might care about the left-right political spectrum, but when you are hustling for food or hoping for basic infrastructure, that's not your biggest concern. Your politics probably focus more on concrete improvements in your standard of living than a theoretical approach to this
- That you only get closer to understanding inequality by experiencing it - or at least listening to those that live it. There's a whole world of difference between a farmer praying for rain to feed her family and being conceptually aware that inequality exists somewhere in the world

Some interesting cultural experiences (by no means exhaustive):
- East Africa is all about the hustle. One friend works an IT job, while creating websites for businesses, running a blog / news site, and building a marketplace for farming advice on the side. Another interns for an NGO, while doing a marketing masters and designing clothes. Some of their stories are heartbreaking and the commitment incredible
- For all that being white is a position of priviledge, you can also be something of an exoticism or a target. Walk around and you'll hear people calling out to you "mzungu, mzungu" - basically, hey white person. And you'll be asked for money and followed around by kids (and some adults). If you're a woman you might be judged for the length of your dress. The favourite request of kids in Ethiopia was pens or pencils - even in the most remote areas. It's all part of the deal
