You know when you have a really bad day, and then a really bad week, that turns into a bad month. And you know you're in a spiral, and you can even visualise what needs to change. Why am I turning up to work grumpy, unmotivated to write or learn, sinking slowly into the couch, and into self-loathing  

And that's kinda fine, we all have moods, and one day something snaps you out of it. A friend, the sun, or bottoming out  

But what scares me the most is when the interval between these periods begins to shorten. It takes so much less to start snapping, and so much more effort to get through the day with a smile on my face  

I've noted this particularly in relation to work. It's like some fundamental trust, that once broken, is almost impossible to repair. Where I might have once brushed a problem off as incidental, it becomes personal. And even though I realise this, I can't escape it. It makes me realise how  important passion, team and a strong values based culture is for me. But that's another topic  

More important to me right now, is how to resolve this situation, and in general I've tried three paths  

**Suffer through it.** Life is struggle, so why fight the inevitable disappointment. Appreciate the good in my life, and deal with the disappointments by caring less about them. Hope that things get better and that perseverance is the key. Usually my first choice. But be it job or relationship, they are so important that caring less never seems to work long-term  

**Radical change / fake it till you make it.** If this is a state of mind, I should be able to think my way out of it. Many new hobbies and turning up to work with a smile. Problem is that I'm a cynic. Even if the hobbies stick, the smile feels fake and fades. When something bad happens, I remember all the other bad times and I'm back to square one  

**Flee.** New place, new start. The option of last resort, but one I worry I find increasingly easier to take. Sometimes you just need a fresh start, and I like seeing the world and trying new things, so why not. And it resets the counter before the next struggle - so that's a plus. Also, it's worked quite well for me so far, so why am I worried that it's the "soft" option. Is it just a form of millennial ADHD, or am I taking advantage of the opportunities on offer? Reducing resilience or dodging disaster? And how do I reconcile this with a growing desire to settle and make a home somewhere. Buy real furniture for the first time in a decade. I don't know the answer - and let's be honest, fleeing to Kenya for 6 months is probably not going to make it any clearer
