Do we have a duty to be honest in the workplace? Honestly, I don't know...  

Traditional workplaces have followed a command and control model of organisation, with strict hierarchy preventing anything as intimate as honesty. Like any other risk, truth was simply not one worth taking and we all dealt with it with alcohol and a string of complaints to friends, family and close co-workers  

On the other hand, there's the modern start-up philosophy of openness and equality. If your company is in trouble, tell your employees. If your partner leaves you, tell your boss. If your colleague eats loudly at their desk and it annoys you - tell them. And you'll be rewarded with their trust and a willingness to support you. Your employees might salary sacrifice, your boss might cover for you and you office might finally have some quiet. People are inherently good, so give them a chance to show that  

Yet while many preach this, it turns out to be harder to live. The CEO buries the bad news under so much forced positivity and smudged KPIs, fearing that the funding will stop and everyone will leave. I personally fear that my exposure might do just that - expose me to ridicule or attack. It feels much safer to hold one's card close to one's chest, revealing them only to be emotionally manipulative. And yeah, I'm not just talking about the workplace here...  

Which might suggest that we are a few good people away from an open utopia-like communism. If only we all bought in, none of us would have to sell out. But the reality is, we are yet to reach this Nirvana, so until then, I suggest the toe-in-the-water approach. The next time you have a small idea or problem, share it. See how it goes, and if you feel rewarded, proceed.But don't feel guilted into a career-ending overshare simply because its the shiny, new thing that your boss with Trump levels of self-awareness suggests you do
