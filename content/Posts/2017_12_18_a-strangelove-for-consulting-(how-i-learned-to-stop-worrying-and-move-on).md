Summary: A couple of reasons why leaving consulting was the right decision for me
Status: published

Don't get me wrong - #Consultinglife is great. I've worked with some of the smartest people I know, on fascinating projects, with a lot of responsibility, for billion dollar companies...  

That said, I had a couple of reasons for leaving:  

- **Creating something myself:** To develop and own a product, and see it grow (f**k ups and all) is an amazing experience that I wanted. While the trusted advisor role is a great one, as a consultant, in the end the decision is rarely yours (and same for the consequences)

- **New ways of learning:** The first couple of years in consulting, the responsibility and range of topics covered helped me learn at an exponential rate. But after hitting that consultant promotion, two things happened. First, things began to feel incremental - the problems are different, but you tend to solve them in the same way and the constraints imposed by the client relationship restrict creativity. And second, I felt like I needed a new challenge. Which is not to say that an early stage startup is all roses - but everything can be fascinating the first time around. Drafting terms of service, posting on every job platform in Germany, doing accounts - these aren't the sexiest tasks, but they give you a fantastic appreciation for what it's like to build a business. And then there's the fun stuff: figuring out how to sell something by A/B testing pricing; brainstorming, user-testing and prioritising a product roadmap, getting that first positive customer feedback

- **Different ways of working:** How the hell do you work with a developer or a designer? What's it like to sell something? Or provide customer support? In consulting, everyone is super driven and analytical (within a range), and while these teams were amazing, there's an element of close-knit sameness to it. When I worked the same way with the same people day-in-and-out, there's a point at which I believe you stop learning as much and it makes it easier to divorce from reality. There's so much more glorious...mess...out there. Goal-oriented salespeople looking to close. Creative designers that can explain the psychology behind how people use products. I've wanted to, and had a chance to see it all

- **Domain expertise:** I missed learning a subject properly. In the last year I've spent a lot of time reading, looking at data and experimenting with how feedback, SaaS and product management work. As a consultant, you get really good at learning about a lot of new topics all at once, but your knowledge is (to be brutally honest) often shallow - particularly in your early years. It's exciting, but often as fulfilling as truly beginning to understand something

- **Burnout:** Yeah, it's a thing. I'd promise myself before each new case that I'd prioritise, get better at saying no, and make time for friends, exercise and sleep. But it's hard to do that when you're working with people you like and you don't want to let them down. Plus you want to outperform even with so many sharp people. I realised that I hadn't read a book for pleasure in a year. And more importantly I was letting my mental health suffer. If it was that hard to change within an environment where you've already established a pattern of behaviour, it was time for a change
