Title: About Me

So yep. Another blog. By a former consultant turned product manager
working in tech. Shit, if I'd just done an MBA I could have really
hit the cliche trifecta...

So what's this one about? Thematically, it will probably be a mish-mash.  
The struggles of an insecure, overachiever to relax and appreciate just how lucky they are. How I've managed the transition from consultant to product person. Random thoughts about technology, pop-culture and how people make decisions. Basically, it will be as messy as most people's lives are. Which is not to diarise or make too much a mockery of the form - posts won't be ending in XOXO

At the same time, writing this is about feeling creative and playful with words again, and to feel like I've learnt something in the last couple of years. To that end:  

- No business-speak. When it took me 15 minutes to think of how a normal person would say "deep dive", I knew I had a problem  
- This is in Markdown, on a Pelican static blog (wooh Python), and committed to Git so that everything is saved for me to cringe over in a couple of years  
- Pop-culture references and occasional profanity are staples of my spoken English. So are puns and the straying towards the pretentious
