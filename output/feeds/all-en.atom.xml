As a first generation Russian/Moldovan-Jew in Australia, I have a history with a token amount of casual anti-semitism. But to be honest, it has been pretty ok. Certainly I've never had anyone assume I'm not Australian for my skin colour, I don't get checked going through customs, and if I knew how to drive, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have a problem getting pulled over either.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, working for a local NGO in Kenya, I wanted to avoid being another white guy to Kenya to "save them". Which I hope I managed to. And had a bunch of interesting experiences and life lessons along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lessons (for me):&lt;br&gt;
- Not taking for granted interactions with authority. They don't always have the your best interest at heart. It's not that they are inherently bad, just self-interested
- Don't assume the issues that are important or relevant to me, are the same for everyone. I might care about the left-right political spectrum, but when you are hustling for food or hoping for basic infrastructure, that's not your biggest concern. Your politics probably focus more on concrete improvements in your standard of living than a theoretical approach to this
- That you only get closer to understanding inequality by experiencing it - or at least listening to those that live it. There's a whole world of difference between a farmer praying for rain to feed her family and being conceptually aware that inequality exists somewhere in the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting cultural experiences (by no means exhaustive):
- East Africa is all about the hustle. One friend works an IT job, while creating websites for businesses, running a blog / news site, and building a marketplace for farming advice on the side. Another interns for an NGO, while doing a marketing masters and designing clothes. Some of their stories are heartbreaking and the commitment incredible
- For all that being white is a position of priviledge, you can also be something of an exoticism or a target. Walk around and you'll hear people calling out to you "mzungu, mzungu" - basically, hey white person. And you'll be asked for money and followed around by kids (and some adults). If you're a woman you might be judged for the length of your dress. The favourite request of kids in Ethiopia was pens or pencils - even in the most remote areas. It's all part of the deal&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Dealing with a spiral</title><link href="https://jlevski.github.io/pelicanblog/dealing-with-a-spiral.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-05T21:57:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-05T21:57:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Josh Levin</name></author><id>tag:jlevski.github.io,2018-08-05:/pelicanblog/dealing-with-a-spiral.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How I try to manage those bad days (weeks, months...)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know when you have a really bad day, and then a really bad week, that turns into a bad month. And you know you're in a spiral, and you can even visualise what needs to change. Why am I turning up to work grumpy, unmotivated to write or learn, sinking slowly into the couch, and into self-loathing  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's kinda fine, we all have moods, and one day something snaps you out of it. A friend, the sun, or bottoming out  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what scares me the most is when the interval between these periods begins to shorten. It takes so much less to start snapping, and so much more effort to get through the day with a smile on my face  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noted this particularly in relation to work. It's like some fundamental trust, that once broken, is almost impossible to repair. Where I might have once brushed a problem off as incidental, it becomes personal. And even though I realise this, I can't escape it. It makes me realise how  important passion, team and a strong values based culture is for me. But that's another topic  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important to me right now, is how to resolve this situation, and in general I've tried three paths  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suffer through it.&lt;/strong&gt; Life is struggle, so why fight the inevitable disappointment. Appreciate the good in my life, and deal with the disappointments by caring less about them. Hope that things get better and that perseverance is the key. Usually my first choice. But be it job or relationship, they are so important that caring less never seems to work long-term  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical change / fake it till you make it.&lt;/strong&gt; If this is a state of mind, I should be able to think my way out of it. Many new hobbies and turning up to work with a smile. Problem is that I'm a cynic. Even if the hobbies stick, the smile feels fake and fades. When something bad happens, I remember all the other bad times and I'm back to square one  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flee.&lt;/strong&gt; New place, new start. The option of last resort, but one I worry I find increasingly easier to take. Sometimes you just need a fresh start, and I like seeing the world and trying new things, so why not. And it resets the counter before the next struggle - so that's a plus. Also, it's worked quite well for me so far, so why am I worried that it's the "soft" option. Is it just a form of millennial ADHD, or am I taking advantage of the opportunities on offer? Reducing resilience or dodging disaster? And how do I reconcile this with a growing desire to settle and make a home somewhere. Buy real furniture for the first time in a decade. I don't know the answer - and let's be honest, fleeing to Kenya for 6 months is probably not going to make it any clearer&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>My Crazy Addiction: Phone Withdrawal</title><link href="https://jlevski.github.io/pelicanblog/my-crazy-addiction:-phone-withdrawal.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-05T18:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-04-05T18:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Josh Levin</name></author><id>tag:jlevski.github.io,2018-04-05:/pelicanblog/my-crazy-addiction:-phone-withdrawal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What happens when I lose my phone&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had my phone stolen in Ethiopia. A couple of kids grabbed at me, while another took the phone out of my pocket, and that was that. Afterwards, a journey through the Addis policing system that left us fearing we were more likely to be arrested than given a report. And that was only after visiting 5 different police stations  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week after taught me a bit about myself. The phone I wrote off immediately. But it felt like a part of me had left with it. Maybe that's melodramatic, but it terrifies me how dependant I've become  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are the practical dependencies. If something goes wrong, I can't call out. I can't use maps to find my way around the city. It's much harder to find or book a hotel or restaurant. To take photos of beautiful or interesting things. To message friends and family to let them know I'm ok or to make them jealous. These are all valid reasons why losing your phone is the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my phone is also the way I pass the dead minutes in a taxi scrolling through Facebook. Or the 15 minutes that turn into an hour reading the news when I should be going to bed. Sitting on the toilet doing German language exercises or checking my email when I wake up. It's Spotify on the way to gym, my workout app at the gym, and food delivery afterwards. Tracking my habits, typing into my journal and reading blogs  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days immediately after, I would reach into my pocket, like an amputee searching for a lost limb. Isn't it bleak (and probably callous) that this is the comparison that comes to mind. But that's how it hit me when I was in the airport watching everyone else fiddle with their phones, while I sat there lost for what to do with my new-found time  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a couple of days later, the fever breaks. I miss how my phone simplifies my life. To get home from a restaurant late at night I ask a mate to order me an Uber while he gets a Taxify. But I find a bit more time to work, read, people watch and even talk to others. And transfer some of my addiction onto my laptop, which has probably never felt so loved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new phone arrives in a couple of weeks, and I'm sure I'll slip headlong back into it. But until then, I remember that there was a world before my mobile&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>After Consulting</title><link href="https://jlevski.github.io/pelicanblog/after-consulting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-18T12:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-12-18T12:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Josh Levin</name></author><id>tag:jlevski.github.io,2017-12-18:/pelicanblog/after-consulting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of reasons why leaving consulting was the right decision for me&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong - consulting was great. I've worked with some of the smartest people I know, on fascinating projects, with a lot of responsibility, for billion dollar companies...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I left to:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create something myself:&lt;/strong&gt; To develop and own a product, and see it grow (f**k ups and all) is an  experience that I wanted. As a consultant you get to advise, but in the end the decision is rarely yours (and same for the consequences)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn in new ways:&lt;/strong&gt; The first couple of years in consulting, the responsibility and range of topics covered helped me learn at an exponential rate. But after hitting that consultant promotion, two things happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, things began to feel incremental - the problems are different, but you tend to solve them in the same way and the constraints imposed by the client relationship restrict creativity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I felt like I needed new challenges. Which is not to say that an early stage startup is all roses - but everything can be fascinating the first time around. Drafting terms of service, posting on every job platform in Germany, doing accounts - these aren't the sexiest tasks, but they give you a fantastic appreciation for what it's like to build a business. And then there's the fun stuff: figuring out how to sell something by A/B testing pricing; brainstorming, user-testing and prioritising a product roadmap, getting that first positive customer feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work in new ways:&lt;/strong&gt; How the hell do you work with a developer or a designer? What's it like to sell something? Or provide customer support? In consulting, everyone is super driven and analytical (within a range), and while these teams were amazing, there's an element of close-knit sameness to it. When I worked the same way with the same people day-in-and-out, there's a point at which I believe you stop learning as much and it makes it easier to divorce from reality. There's so much more glorious...mess...out there. Goal-oriented salespeople looking to close. Creative designers that can explain the psychology behind how people use products. I've wanted to, and had a chance to see it all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build domain expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; I missed understanding a topic deeply. In the last year I've spent a lot of time reading, looking at data and experimenting with how feedback, SaaS and product management work. As a consultant, you get really good at learning about a lot of new topics all at once, but your knowledge is (to be brutally honest) often shallow - particularly in your early years. It's exciting, but often as fulfilling as truly beginning to understand something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid burnout:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it's a thing. I'd promise myself before each new case that I'd prioritise, get better at saying no, and make time for friends, exercise and sleep. But it's hard to do that when you're working with people you like and you don't want to let them down. Plus you want to outperform even with so many sharp people. I realised that I hadn't read a book for pleasure in a year. And more importantly I was letting my mental health suffer. If it was that hard to change within an environment where you've already established a pattern of behaviour, it was time for a change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content></entry></feed>
